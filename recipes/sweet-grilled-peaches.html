<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Peaches are spruced up with a little honey and a dash of cinnamon before being packaged into foil and cooked on the grill. As my husband says, these taste like a peach cobbler without the crust!</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
    <li>1 (16 ounce) package frozen peach slices</li>
    <li>1/2 cup honey</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons cinnamon</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>

<ol>
    <li>Preheat a grill for medium heat.</li>
    <li>Place peaches onto a large piece of aluminum foil. Use two if necessary to hold in all of the peaches without spillage. Drizzle the honey over the peaches, and sprinkle with cinnamon. Close up the foil, sealing tightly.</li>
    <li>Place the foil packet onto the preheated grill, and cook for 10 minutes, turning once halfway through. Carefully open the packet, and serve.</li>
</ol>
